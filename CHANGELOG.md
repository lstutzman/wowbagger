# Changelog

Behaviour changes land here when they ship, not when someone remembers them.
A change to what a command accepts, refuses, emits, or writes is a behaviour
change even when the commit that carried it was labelled refactor, docs, or
consolidation. The first tagged release inherits this file.

## Unreleased

### Behaviour changes

- A claim request carrying an own `__proto__` member is refused as
  `invalid-request`. Previously three of four drifted JSON normalizer copies
  silently erased the member, so the shipped adapter accepted a request its
  own conformance runner would have refused. The consolidation into one
  normalizer (`src/request.js`) shipped inside an adapter commit and is a
  behaviour change, not a refactor. No stored data is affected: the old code
  erased such a member before it could be persisted.
- `create` refuses a malformed `number` or `priority` at the request level
  with an `/item/number` or `/item/priority` issue. Previously a bad value
  surfaced later as a generic `candidate-invalid`.
- `create` serializes caller-supplied `number` directly after `id` and
  `priority` directly after `kind`. Previously both landed after the
  extension members at the end of the frontmatter.
- The refusal for a caller-supplied `status` on create now teaches the
  lifecycle rule: create assigns triage, and a transition from triage to
  backlog accepts the item into ready.
- `inspect`, `create`, `transition`, and `patch` results include `number` and
  `priority` in `core` when the item carries them. Previously both were
  recoverable only by decoding `source_base64`.

### Added

- `wowbagger patch` changes an item's caller-supplied fields — `number` and
  `priority` — under the same per-ID lock, revision compare-and-swap, and
  candidate validation as transition. Mutation contract section 9.
- `wowbagger mint-id` prints a canonical item ID; `--date` selects the
  creation date; `src/mint.js` exports `mintId`. No consumer writes Crockford
  base32 again.
- `ready` without `--json` prints a human queue: `#number pri=priority title`
  per ready item, in ready order. `ready --json` is byte-identical to before.
- `priority` restored to the ready ordering with validation, and `number`, a
  short integer handle, on every item (shipped 2026-08-07; recorded in
  ADR-0006).
